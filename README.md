# The Grail 2 Theorem Prover

The Grail system is a tool for the development and prototyping of grammar fragments for categorial logics. Grail is an automated theorem prover based on proof nets, a graph-based representation of proofs, and labeled deduction.

The Grail 2 theorem prover is implemented in SICStus Prolog, the user interface in TclTk. Though I would like to continue to provide support for Grail 2, I do not have a SICStus license. Please contact me when you encounter any problems.

[Grail 0](https://github.com/RichardMoot/Grail0), a a reduced version of the Grail 2 parser, without the user interface, can be found here. Grail 0 is recommended for users primarily interested in the natural deduction proofs generated by Grail.

For all other users, a next generation Grail theorem prover, [Grail 3](https://github.com/RichardMoot/Grail), has replaced Grail 2 as the current, stable and supported version of Grail. Grail 3 has a legacy mode which allows you to used your old Grail 2 grammars without any changes. Grail 3 does not support natural deduction output.
